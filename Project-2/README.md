This document outlines the setup and usage instructions for Project-2, which includes environment variable configuration, version control ignore settings, and a Python script to retrieve all projects.

Instructions:
1. Create a `.env` file and populate it with the necessary environment variables.
2. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.
3. Ensure the `get_all_projects.py` script is present in the project directory.
4. Install the required dependency by running: `pip install python-dotenv`.
5. Execute the script using: `python get_all_projects.py`.

Refer to this guide whenever setting up or running Project-2.
