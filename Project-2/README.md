## 🚀 Setup & Usage Instructions

1. **Create a `.env` file:**  
   Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., API credentials) required by the script.

2. **Ignore `.env` in version control:**  
   Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to keep sensitive data out of your repository.

3. **Install dependencies:**  
   Run the following command to install the required package:
   ```
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Run the script:**  
   Execute the script with:
   ```
   python get_all_projects.py
   ```
