#### Method Overloading vs Method Overriding in Object-Oriented Programming

- Understanding the difference between **method overloading** and **method overriding** is essential for mastering object-oriented programming concepts. Both techniques allow developers to write flexible and reusable code, but they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

-  Both overloading and overriding are related to polymorphism, but they are different types of polymorphism.

- Below is a comparison table highlighting the key aspects of method overloading and method overriding:

| Aspect               | **Method Overloading**                                                | **Method Overriding**                                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**       | Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters          | Redefining a method in the child class with the same signature as in the parent class            |
| **Occurs at**        | Compile-time (Static Polymorphism)                                    | Runtime (Dynamic Polymorphism)                                                                   |
| **Purpose**          | Allows a method to behave differently based on the arguments passed   | Enables a child class to modify or extend the behavior of the parent class method                |
| **Parameter Types**  | Different parameter numbers or types                                  | Same method signature (same name and parameters)                                                 |
| **Method Signature** | Method signature changes (different parameter lists)                  | Method signature remains the same                                                                |
| **Example Language** | C++, Java (not natively supported in Python)                          | Python, Java, C++                                                                                |

> **Note:**  

> - **Method Overloading** is commonly used in languages like Java and C++, but Python does not support it natively.  
> - **Method Overriding** is widely used in Python, Java, and C++ to implement polymorphism and customize inherited behavior.

---

- Use **method overloading** when you need multiple ways to call a method depending on the input parameters.

- Use **method overriding** when you want a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
