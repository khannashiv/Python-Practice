#### Concepts of OOP ####

    # Class: A blueprint that defines attributes (data) and methods (functions).
    # Object: An instance of a class that holds real data and can perform actions.
    # Methods: Functions inside a class that define the behavior of the objects.
    # Inheritance: Creating new classes that inherit from existing ones to reuse code.
    # Encapsulation: Controlling access to attributes using public, protected, and private attributes.

    # Variables: General term for any named reference to data.
    # Data Members / Attributes: Variables associated with a class (instance variables).
    # Arguments:  Values passed to a function when it is called.
    # Parameters: Variables in the function definition that receive the argument values.
    # Local Variables:    Variables defined inside a function, limited to that functionâ€™s scope.
    # Instance Variables: Data members tied to a specific object (instance).
    # Class Variables:    Variables that belong to the class itself, shared across all instances.
